sfDoxygen plugin
===============

The `sfDoxygenPlugin` is a symfony plugin that provides tasks to
generate your sourcecode documentation via Doxygen.

Installation
------------

  * Install the plugin via the subversion repository or by using the command:

        ./symfony plugin:install sfDoxygenPlugin

Configuration files
-------------------

  * doxygen.cfg - the main doxygen config file

  * doxygen.ini - file used to store your custom doxygen docs configuration
    options. All the options defined here will be applied to doxygen.cfg when
    doxygen:update task will be performed (and therefore applied while
    generating the docs during execution of doxygen:generate).

  * exclude.txt - file containing all paths that should be excluded from
    generating the documentation. Paths existent in this file are concatenated 
    and put into the EXCLUDE option of doxygen. Similar to $/config/rsync_exclude.txt.

  * exclude_patterns.txt - similar to exclude.txt with the difference that
    it supports the EXCLUDE_PATTERNS option.

  * doxygen.xml - specifying the layout. Used within Doxygen version 1.5.7
    or above.

  * All files contain default values which are sufficient to perform code
    documentation generation.

Usage
-----

  * Execute the tasks bundled with the plugin in the order specified below.
    The first command creates file structure in $/config/doxygen directory 
    (use this task only once otherwise the changes you made will be lost):

        $ ./symfony doxygen:init

  * Next step is to make your custom changes to the config/doxygen.ini file.
    You may specify all options that would be used by the doxygen tool (few
    important ones are already defined there, such as PROJECT_NAME). After
    editing config/doxygen.ini, run the following command to update the
    doxygen.cfg file. Take a look at official doxygen documentation for more
    details:

        $ ./symfony doxygen:update

  * And finally, the last step. It will generate the whole documentation
    in the doc/doxygen directory (of course you can change it).

        $ ./symfony doxygen:generate

  * Additionally you may check the version of Doxygen installed using command:
  
        $ ./symfony doxygen:version

Documentation
-------------

By default, the documentation should include all lib class files created by the
developer, that is: all non-base model classes (excluding base classes, 
migration classes, vendor). Moreover, action classes should be included (but
their templates are set to be excluded).


Notes
-----

  * You need to install doxygen before you can use following plugin. More
    information can be found here: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/install.html

  * Remember to add a line to the config/rsync_exclude.txt file to exclude the
    generated documentation from being sent to the production server.

  * You may configure your vhost to show the doxygen documentation by adding
    the following code:

        Alias /dox /path_to_my_project/doc/doxygen/html
